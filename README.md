# Infinite Terrain

A simple infinite terrain implementation, rendering powered by
[Three.js](http://threejs.org/).

This includes a gulp pipeline which supports ES6 (via Babel) along with a
watcher that automatically rebuilds upon modifying any files in `src/`.


## To use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/bdero/infinite-terrain.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the watcher using the **dev** command: `npm run dev`
4. Begin hacking on the code, and the watcher will automatically recompile on save.
